        <p>Little Lemon is owned by two Italian brothers, Mario and Adrian. Focusing on traditional recipes served with a modern twist, the chefs draw inspiration from Italian, Greek, and Turkish culture.  To craft the menu, Mario relies on family recipes and his experience as a chef in Italy. Adrian does all the marketing for the restaurant and led the effort to expand the menu beyond classic Italian to incorporate additional cuisines from the mediterranean region.</p>
